Changes since 0.6.3


Added a CDNLayer sample
Refactor slapiCall and realCall to clean up a bit of a mess, fix method parameter handling, and cleans up header handling. There's a bit of an api change here.
Clean up initParamater handling (so that it actually works again)
Allow the base class to be replaced with another.
Split softlayer.rb into three files, one containing just the base class, another containing 
the header and exception classes.

Change since 0.6.1

Silenced the name space warning (I think this is a bug in soap4r)
Created an exception class that's really used as a proxy for soap exceptions.  This exception is 
raised in a few places where needed.

Changes since 0.6.0.

Implement SoftLayer::Base#call to make dynamic method calls possible.
Fix a reference to a renamed class (ParamHeader -> Param)

Changes since 0.5.0.

Implemented resultLimit headers.  See readme and the rdoc for SoftLayer::ResultLimit.
Renamed SoftLayer::ObjectMaskHeader to SoftLayer::ObjectMask and SoftLayer::ParamHeader to SoftLayer::Param
